# Configuration

Variables to configure MySQL docker container.

# Run 

Build the war and copy it to `lutece.war` in the main directory.
Then run `docker-compose up`. Mysql, tomcat, and lutece-init containers will start.
The mysql container keeps its db in a volume. The tomcat container will
deploy `lutece.war` and redeploy any updates. The lutece-init container will initialize the db
if needed and then exit.

# Application Functionality Summary
Administrative access to the application enables the ability to design the structure of the site
(page tree) and to modify the format and content of each of the pages. 

From the Site dropdown menu,
Site Administration allows the admin to make any edits to the public site while Management of the
properties of the site allows the admin to edit the default properties. Not exactly sure what Role 
Management Lutece is used for. 

From the managers dropdown menu, User Management provides a list of 
users of the application, their first and last name, access code, email, and status. The stock icons
to the right of each of the users direct the admin to each of the given properties of a user (user
identity/attributes, password, rights, roles, and workgroups). Through these fields (when clicked upon
and navigated) allow the admin to change the attributes of each of the users. By selecting advanced 
settings in the User Management home page, the admin has the ability to change the default values when
creating a user, modify the model of the email, change security and notification settings, set which
fields need to be made anonymous, and manage attributes. In the main page of User Management, also have
the ability to import and export the users and add a new user.
